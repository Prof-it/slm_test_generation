# Oracle-site review protocol

## Rater task

Independently classify the single oracle identified by `oracle_source`, using its
enclosing test and focal function for context. Do not classify neighboring assertions.
Do not consult classifier output, AI audits, `first_rater_labels.csv`, or result reports
until all 250 ratings are complete.

First record whether the oracle depends on a value/state produced by the system under
test in `second_rater_sut_dependent`: `true`, `false`, or `unsure`. Then assign:

- **TRIVIAL:** statically satisfied, tautological, self-comparison, constant-only, or
  otherwise unable to fail because of focal behavior.
- **WEAK:** depends on focal behavior but checks only a coarse property such as
  existence, truthiness, non-nullness, type, non-emptiness, or a broad shape/property.
- **STRONG:** checks a specific behavioral contract: expected value/content, precise
  state transition, expected exception/warning, or a verified mock interaction tied
  to focal behavior.
- **UNKNOWN:** the shown evidence is insufficient to determine dependency or strength
  safely. Explain the unresolved provenance or ambiguity; do not use UNKNOWN merely
  because classification is difficult.

For compound predicates, classify by the strongest meaningful SUT-dependent branch;
if provenance cannot be resolved, use UNKNOWN. An assertion about mocked state is
STRONG only when the mock is demonstrably the relevant dependency. A specific-looking
comparison that is not connected to focal output/state is UNKNOWN or TRIVIAL, not
automatically STRONG.

Apply these edge cases consistently:

- `assert x`, `assert x is not None`, type-only checks, and `assert len(x) > 0` are
  normally WEAK when `x` is SUT-derived; they are TRIVIAL when statically guaranteed.
- Equality to a literal or independently computed expected value is STRONG when it
  expresses a specific focal contract. Equality between a value and itself is TRIVIAL.
- `pytest.raises(ExpectedError)` and `pytest.warns(ExpectedWarning)` are STRONG only
  when the enclosed focal action is what must raise/warn. An empty or unrelated block
  is UNKNOWN/TRIVIAL as appropriate.
- `assert_called*`, `assert_awaited*`, and equivalent mock checks are STRONG only when
  the mock is a dependency exercised by the focal function; checking setup state alone
  is TRIVIAL.
- An assertion located in a statically unreachable branch is TRIVIAL for runtime-gate
  purposes. If reachability depends on unavailable runtime facts, use UNKNOWN and note it.
- Parametrization changes inputs, not oracle strength. Rate the sampled oracle site once
  based on the contract it expresses across parameters.
- For helper assertion functions, follow the helper only when its behavior is present
  in the supplied evidence; otherwise use UNKNOWN rather than guessing.
- When a test contains multiple assertions, rate only the sampled `oracle_id`. A
  compound assertion is one site; separate assertion statements are separate sites.
- Static presence and runtime execution are distinct. The class describes the sampled
  oracle's semantics; `second_rater_sut_dependent` records provenance. Do not infer that
  an oracle executed merely because it is statically present.

If the required source is missing, use `NOT_RATEABLE_MISSING_EVIDENCE`; this is an
administrative exclusion. Reserve UNKNOWN for a present oracle whose semantics or SUT
provenance cannot safely be resolved.

Record confidence (`high`, `medium`, `low`) and notes for every UNKNOWN, UNSURE,
NOT_RATEABLE, or low-confidence decision. Before returning the file, confirm all 250 rows are rated and
that row IDs/order are unchanged.
